    <p>By taking the World Happiness Index into account we are planning to analyze how the
happiness of people vary across the different regions of the world. Which places are happiest
and unhappiest. How different factors contribute to happiness and satisfaction of people. Using
the temporal aspect of the data, happiness index is compared over time. Happiness of
individuals is subjective and effected by a number of factors through this project we aim to
analyze these factors and how they contribute to the overall happiness of a country/region. The
project also aims to visualize the effect of political factors on the life satisfaction of the people.</p>

<div id="Q1para">
  Wikipedia defines happiness as: Happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of
  pleasant emotional states, such as joy, amusement, satisfaction, gratification, euphoria, and
  triumph. Many factors play a role in the happiness of an individual, when defining the happiness
  index across countries many attributes play a factor like Democratic Quality, GDP Per Capita,
  Social Support for an individual, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Corruption, Confidence in National
  Government. With these many factors into play, Scandinavian Countries, Northern America top

<h3><a href="javascript:;" id="Q2text">Life Changes and so does Happiness</a></h3>
<div id="Q2para">
  Happiness is a state of well-being that encompasses living a good life. Happiness is subjective
  and can change over time or due to certain conditions as well. When you ask an individual
  about his happiness at a particular time his answer will depend on the recent happenings in life,
  with that being said it may happen that his answer will change after a given period of time. For
  most of the countries, the happiness index has only increased over time from 2010 to 2018 for
  countries like Iceland, Finland Which were in the top happy to begin with in 2010. Malawi and
  Syria have a maximum deficit in happiness from 2010 to 2018 and these countries were part of
  bottom happy countries.
